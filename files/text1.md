The File interface provides information about files and allows JavaScript to access their contents.

They are usually retrieved from a [FileList](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileList) object that is returned as a result of the user selecting files through the [ element <input>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Input), object [DataTransfer](https://developer.mozilla.org/ en -US/ docs/Web/API/DataTransfer) used in drag and drop operations, or the `mozGetAsFile()` API on an [HTMLCanvasElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ HTMLCanvasElement). In Gecko, privileged code can create File objects representing any local file without user interaction (see [Implementation Notes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File#implementation_notes) for more information.).
